I am a passionate and certified DevOps/SRE professional focused on building robust, scalable, and highly automated infrastructure. I bridge the gap between development and operations by implementing CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and comprehensive monitoring solutions. I strongly believe in the **"Everything as Code"** philosophy to ensure repeatability, reliability, and efficiency.

My toolbox includes **Kubernetes, AWS, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, and Python** for automation scripting.
